# Future Improvements for Task Management App
Here are some potential future improvements and features you could consider adding to the Task Management API.

## 1. Task Priority Management
- **Custom Priorities:** Allow users to define their own priorities, instead of using predefined ones like "low", "medium", and "high".
- **Priority Notifications:** Set up email or push notifications based on task priority, especially for high-priority tasks.

## 2. User Notifications
- **Email Reminders:** Send reminders for upcoming tasks, overdue tasks, or status updates.
- **Push Notifications:** Integrate push notifications for task updates, especially for real-time collaboration.

## 3. Task Recurrence
- **Recurring Tasks:** Implement recurring tasks (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly) with automatic creation of future tasks.

## 4. Time Tracking
- **Task Time Logging:** Allow users to log the time spent on each task. This could include a start/end time and calculate the total time spent on the task.
- **Timer Integration:** Implement a simple stopwatch or timer feature to start and stop the clock while working on tasks.

## 5. Advanced Searching and Filtering
- **Custom Filters:** Allow users to create custom search filters (e.g., "tasks assigned to me", "overdue tasks").
- **Full-Text Search:** Implement a more advanced search that includes full-text search capabilities (e.g., searching for tasks by keywords in the title and description).

## 6. Task Dependencies and Milestones
- **Task Dependencies:** While you've removed this, you can later reintroduce task dependencies, which would allow tasks to be dependent on others before they can be started or completed.
- **Milestones:** Define key milestones for larger tasks/projects and track progress towards these milestones.

## 7. Collaboration Features
- **Shared Tasks:** Allow multiple users to collaborate on the same task, with features like shared comments, file attachments, and live task updates.
- **Team Dashboards:** Implement a dashboard view for teams to get an overview of all tasks, statuses, and team activities.

## 8. User and Role Management
- **Multiple User Roles:** Expand on user roles, allowing for more granular permissions, such as:
  - **Admins** can manage tasks and users.
  - **Managers** can assign tasks but cannot manage other users.
  - **Regular users** can only view and manage their own tasks.
- **User Profiles:** Include user profile settings (e.g., profile picture, display name, timezone, etc.).

## 9. Task Analytics and Reporting
- **Reports:** Generate reports on task progress, user productivity, task completion rates, etc.
- **Visual Analytics:** Implement graphs and charts to visually display task statistics, deadlines, and overall progress.

## 10. Third-Party Integrations
- **Calendar Integration:** Integrate with Google Calendar or Outlook to sync task due dates with personal or team calendars.
- **Slack or Teams Integration:** Allow users to receive task updates and notifications directly in Slack or Microsoft Teams.
- **Time Tracking Tools:** Integrate with time tracking tools like Toggl or Harvest for users who need to track billable hours.

## 11. Audit Logs
- **Task Change Logs:** Record changes to tasks (e.g., status updates, assignee changes) and store them in an audit log for future reference.

## 12. Customizable Task Fields
- **Custom Fields:** Allow admins to define custom fields that are specific to the type of task (e.g., cost estimation, client name, or contract details).

## 13. Mobile App Support
- **Mobile Application:** Develop a mobile version of your task management system for iOS and Android, allowing users to manage tasks on the go.
- **Offline Mode:** Support offline mode so users can view and update tasks even without internet connectivity.

## 14. API Rate Limiting and Security Enhancements
- **API Rate Limiting:** Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse of your API, especially if it's publicly exposed.
- **Role-Based Permissions:** Enhance the permissions and access control for API users to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions.
- **API Security Audits:** Regular security audits and improvements to avoid vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).
